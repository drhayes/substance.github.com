    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>HTML/XML import export:</strong> Substance interacts well with HTML/XML content. E.g. you can import whole XML documents or insert HTML fragments from the clipboard.

      <h3>Composer</h3>
      Substance Composer is a prototype of a destkop application that let's you create and share professional web-first publications. Substance Composer is currently not under active development, since we focussed on building editing components rather than full-fledged apps.
